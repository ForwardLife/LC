In order to prevent passengers from being too bored during the flight,
LQ Airlines decided to play two movies during the flight. Since the movie 
cannot be played during the take-off and landing of the aircraft, LQ Airlines must ensure that
the duration of the two movies to be less than or equal to the flight duration minus 30 minutes, 
and the total length of the two movies should be as long as possible. Now given t ,the flight 
duration(minutes), and array dur[],the length of movies. Please output the length of the two 
movies in order of length. If there are multiple groups of the same length,
select the one which contains the longest single moive.It is guarantee that there is a least one solution.

类似于two sum，先排序。
